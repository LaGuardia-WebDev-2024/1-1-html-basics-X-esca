<h1>
  Brutus
  </h1> 
  <p>By the Buttress</p> 
  <p>I've been watching him for my entire life<br>
I hate the air he breathes, his foolish decrees <br>
His words so contrived <br>
And I hate the way the townspeople gather outside<br>
They hang on every breath, cling to his chest<br>
Home to his heart full of pride</p> 
  <p>
    The oracle told him to beware the Ides<br>
And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't wishing<br>
For untimely death or demise<br>
Or am I just wishing I could be like you?<br>
That the people would see me too as a poet<br>
And not just the muse
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, it's not true, I don't wish harm upon you<br>
From birth we've been like brothers of different mothers<br>
Within the spirit of the same womb<br>
May the gods strike me down if I forsake you<br>
Frater meus, you're beautifully made<br>
And to you I'm forever grateful
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll never forget that you showed me to make art<br>
And I know the love you showed me came<br>
From a pure and noble heart<br>
I love you, and if you want, I'll call you King<br>
But why do I lie awake each night thinking<br>
"Instead of you, it should be me"?
  </p>
  <p>
    Something wicked this way comes<br>
And as I set to face it, I'm unsure<br>
Should I embrace it, should I run?<br>
What motivates me? Hatred? Is it love?<br>
What's more wrong; that I too wish to be great<br>
Or my mother wished she'd had a son?<br>
And even if I can't be the one<br>
Maybe I could at least help make way for him<br>
Until the day that he comes<br>
Maybe my name could also be known<br>
That I helped return good to the people<br>
And restored greatness to Rome
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Brutus and my name means heavy<br>
So with a heavy heart<br>
I'll guide this dagger into the heart of my enemy<br>
My whole life, you were a teacher and friend to me<br>
Please know my actions are not motivated only by envy<br>
I, too, have a destiny<br>
This death will be art<br>
The people will speak of this day from near and afar<br>
This event will be history, and I'll be great too<br>
I don't want what you have, I want to be YOU<br>
